Trump said his advisers didn’t want him to talk about his plans to pardon his supporters who rioted at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, but suggested he would soon follow through on his many pledges to pardon them for their crimes that day. “And I think this a better speech than the one I made upstairs,” Trump said after he was more than half an hour into his second set of remarks."

When Trump arrived in Washington eight years ago, he shocked the establishment with a speech now short-handed as “American Carnage.” This sequel was similar in its angry, bleak tone but amped up with little of the polish that some in Washington had hoped would signal Trump’s second term might be less spiteful than the first go-around. “From this moment on, America’s decline is over,” Trump said in the vetted speech as his predecessor looked on. And hello to the golden age of America,” Trump deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Sunday evening at that campaign rally. The American people have spoken,” Trump said in the Capitol Rotunda on Monday."
