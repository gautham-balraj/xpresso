       "'## Summary\\n\\nThe US IT sector stock market experienced a significant decline, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow Jones indices all sliding due to losses in Big Tech stocks. The decline was largely driven by fears that advances in artificial intelligence by Chinese companies, particularly DeepSeek, could threaten the dominance of American technology giants. Nvidia, a leading chipmaker whose equipment powers advanced AI systems, saw its stock drop by over 14% as investors reevaluated the company\\'s valuation and the potential impact of Chinese AI startups on its business. The \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks, which have driven the market\\'s gains this year, are now facing concerns about the impact of Chinese AI startups on their business.\\n\\nThe selloff in big technology stocks has resulted in a $1.1 trillion tech rout, with the Nasdaq 100 suffering its first five-day losing streak since the first week of January. Information technology was the S&P\\'s worst-performing sector, declining 2.5%, with more than 2% drops from shares of Amazon, Meta, and Nvidia leading the charge. The introduction of DeepSeek\\'s new, low-cost AI model has sparked fears that the Chinese company may burst Silicon Valley\\'s bubble, leading to a reevaluation of the valuations of US tech companies.\\n\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.5%, or over 600 points, while the S&P 500 dropped 2.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite pulled back 3.3%. The decline was also fueled by recession fears, with the weaker jobs report sparking concerns that the Fed is now too late in its cutting cycle. Analysts from Wedbush Securities noted that the \"perfect storm panicked tech sell-off has now gained steam\" after the weaker jobs report fueled recession fears and worries about the Fed\\'s cutting cycle.\\n\\nInvestors are turning their attention to the Federal Reserve\\'s path for interest rates and the implications of Donald Trump\\'s ascent back to the White House, which are expected to shape the market\\'s direction in the coming year. Despite the daily losses, the US stock market has still had a largely triumphant year, with weekly gains holding steady. The market\\'s reaction to the advances in artificial intelligence by Chinese companies will be closely watched, as it may have significant implications for the valuations of US tech companies and the overall direction of the market.\\n\\nAs the year comes to a close, the US stock market is expected to continue to be driven by the two big themes of the Federal Reserve\\'s interest rate path and the implications of Donald Trump\\'s presidency. The \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks, which have driven the market\\'s gains this year, are expected to remain under pressure due to concerns about the impact of Chinese AI startups on their business. Nvidia, in particular, is expected to be closely watched, as its equipment powers the most advanced AI systems and its valuation is highly dependent on the continued growth of the AI industry. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite are all expected to remain volatile, as investors continue to reevaluate the valuations of US tech companies and the potential impact of Chinese AI startups on their business.\\n\\nMicrosoft saw the least volatility out of the major tech stocks, falling 4.8 percent at market open Monday, while Nvidia saw the biggest drop out of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, opening 14.2 percent down compared to market close on Friday. The perfect storm of panicked tech sell-off has now gained steam after the weaker jobs report fueled recession fears and worries the Fed is now too late in its cutting cycle with tech stocks in the center of this Category 5 storm sell-off. Premarket trading implied steep declines for U.S. markets, with the pain concentrated at companies at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom. Stock markets fell sharply on Monday, dragged down by fears that advances in artificial intelligence by Chinese upstarts could threaten the moneymaking power of American technology giants.\\n\\nThe tech sector dragged US stocks lower on Monday, with major indexes down about 1%. The extended decline in the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 can be linked to rising bond yields over the past few weeks. Markets have largely digested the year\\'s remaining key economic data points, and investors are now turning their attention to two big themes for the coming year: the Federal Reserve\\'s path for interest rates and the implications of Donald Trump\\'s ascent back to the White House. Gains from earlier in the week were enough to lift US stocks despite a day in the red, continuing a largely triumphant year with just two more trading days remaining in 2024. Investor enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence has once again driven the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks to another banner year.\\n\\nThe Nasdaq and S&P 500 were down sharply, with the Dow turning positive, as a tech rout sparked by China\\'s AI startup DeepSeek led to a $1.1 trillion decline in the tech sector. Nvidia dropped 14%, and the pain was concentrated at companies at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom. The culprit behind the decline was DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence company that introduced a new, low-cost model into the red-hot AI tech market. Shares of Nvidia, the chip company whose AI technology has made it into one of the most valuable companies in the world, dropped more than 13 percent by late morning on Monday. At least investors will soon get to grill Big Tech companies about DeepSeek and their overall AI strategies.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the US stock market extended its losses, with the S&P 500 falling 0.2% and the Nasdaq composite shedding 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a gain of 0.1%, despite declines in the technology and energy sectors. Big Tech stocks, including Nvidia and Microsoft, continued to weigh on the market, with losses in these companies offsetting gains elsewhere. The perfect storm of panicked tech sell-off has now gained steam, with the weaker jobs report fueling recession fears and worries about the Fed\\'s cutting cycle. Analysts from Wedbush Securities noted that tech stocks are at the center of this Category 5 storm sell-off, with Nvidia seeing the biggest drop out of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks.\\n\\nThe decline in tech stocks has been driven by fears that advances in artificial intelligence by Chinese companies, such as DeepSeek, could threaten the dominance of American technology giants. The introduction of DeepSeek\\'s new, low-cost AI model has sparked fears that the Chinese company may burst Silicon Valley\\'s bubble, leading to a reevaluation of the valuations of US tech companies. Investors are rethinking the large returns they are expecting on the heady valuations of chipmakers like Nvidia, as well as the investments that companies like Google, Meta, and OpenAI are making to build their AI businesses. The US stock market is expected to remain volatile, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all expected to be driven by the two big themes of the Federal Reserve\\'s interest rate path and the implications of Donald Trump\\'s presidency.\\n\\n ### Sources:\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-sp-nasdaq-slide-on-big-tech-losses-but-weekly-gains-hold-143206294.html\\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-nasdaq-plunge-leads-s-p-and-dow-lower-on-china-ai-fears\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/us-stock-market-deepseek-ai-sp500-nvidia.html\\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/11/15/big-tech-stocks-suffer-500-billion-selloff-as-dangerously-bullish-rally-loses-steam/\\nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/01/27/nx-s1-5276097/wall-street-stock-markets-tumble-deepseek-ai-tech-stock\\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/11/15/big-tech-stocks-suffer-500-billion-selloff-as-dangerously-bullish-rally-loses-steam/\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-sp-nasdaq-slide-on-big-tech-losses-but-weekly-gains-hold-143206294.html\\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-nasdaq-plunge-leads-s-p-and-dow-lower-on-china-ai-fears\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/us-stock-market-deepseek-ai-sp500-nvidia.html\\nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/01/27/nx-s1-5276097/wall-street-stock-markets-tumble-deepseek-ai-tech-stock\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-sp-nasdaq-slide-on-big-tech-losses-but-weekly-gains-hold-143206294.html\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-dow-slides-600-points-nasdaq-sinks-3-as-nvidia-leads-chip-sell-off-155725785.html\\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/technology/4811859-tech-stocks-plunge-amid-selloff/\\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-nasdaq-plunge-leads-s-p-and-dow-lower-on-china-ai-fears\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/us-stock-market-deepseek-ai-sp500-nvidia.html\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-sp-nasdaq-slide-on-big-tech-losses-but-weekly-gains-hold-143206294.html\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-dow-slides-600-points-nasdaq-sinks-3-as-nvidia-leads-chip-sell-off-155725785.html\\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/technology/4811859-tech-stocks-plunge-amid-selloff/\\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-nasdaq-plunge-leads-s-p-and-dow-lower-on-china-ai-fears\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/us-stock-market-deepseek-ai-sp500-nvidia.html\\nhttps://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-today-tech-leads-us-stocks-lower-year-wraps-2024-12?op=1\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-sp-nasdaq-slide-on-big-tech-losses-but-weekly-gains-hold-143206294.html\\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-nasdaq-plunge-leads-s-p-and-dow-lower-on-china-ai-fears\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/us-stock-market-deepseek-ai-sp500-nvidia.html\\nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/01/27/nx-s1-5276097/wall-street-stock-markets-tumble-deepseek-ai-tech-stock\\nhttps://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-employment-fed-inflation-growth-3c351ab22c11531bb69ff06352f5e7db\\nhttps://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-trump-tariffs-samsung-873db18423f9be7398aeebbf4a94bef4\\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/technology/4811859-tech-stocks-plunge-amid-selloff/\\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-nasdaq-plunge-leads-s-p-and-dow-lower-on-china-ai-fears\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/us-stock-market-deepseek-ai-sp500-nvidia.html'"
